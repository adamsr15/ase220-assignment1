                <p>Hello my name is Robert Adams and I am an Applied Software Engineering student currently studying at Northern Kentucky University (NKU). I love making responsive, accesible, and neatly designed code that helps out people. My overall professional goal is to move into a sector where I am not working for a profit motive, but a moral one.</p>

                <p>Although I spend most of my time either working on studying when I have a moment to myself I like to study other cultures, history, and languages. When I was a child I developed an intence fascination with ancient China and from then on, year after year, I find myself seeking out knowledge about many places around the world. I'd like to believe myself to be an amateur Japanese and European historian.</p>

                <p>A fun fact about me is that I can name all 50 US states, all Canadian provinces and territories, and, if I took a little time to brush up on it, every nation in Europe. I also have a decent understanding of French.</p>
